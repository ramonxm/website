---

In this tutorial, I'll walk you through the process of publishing an NPM package using GitLab's Package Registry within a private repository. This approach allows you to manage private packages efficiently while leveraging GitLab's robust security features.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js (latest version)
- Package manager (npm or yarn)
- GitLab account with a private repository
- A code editor (VSCode or similar)

## 1. Setting Up a Monorepo with Lerna

We'll use Lerna to manage a monorepo structure with Yarn workspaces. This provides a clean way to organize multiple packages.

First, create and initialize your project:

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
npx lerna init
```

## 2. Configuring Lerna

Now, let's configure Lerna by updating the _lerna.json_ file:

```json
{
  "packages": ["packages/*"],
  "npmClient": "yarn",
  "useWorkspaces": true,
  "version": "independent",
  "command": {
    "publish": {
      "registry": "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/<your-project-id>/packages/npm/"
    }
  }
}

// Finding Your Project ID**: Navigate to your GitLab repository settings. The Project ID is the number in the URL after the slash:
-> https://gitlab.com/<your_user>/<your_repository>/edit

// Project ID:
-> 123456
```

## 3. Creating Your Package

Now, let's create a package within your monorepo:

```bash
cd packages
mkdir my-lib
cd my-lib
yarn init # or npm init or pnpm init
```

After initializing the package, open its _package.json_ file and add these important configurations:

```json
{
  "name": "@my-project/my-lib",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  // ... other package.json properties
  "publishConfig": {
    "@my-project:registry": "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/<your-project-id>/packages/npm/"
  },
  "sideEffects": false
}
```

## 4. Setting Up NPM Configuration

Return to the project root directory and create an _.npmrc_ file to configure access to the GitLab Package Registry:

```bash
cd ../..  # Return to project root
touch .npmrc
```

Add the following configuration to your _.npmrc_ file:

```bash
@my-project:registry=https://gitlab.com/api/v4/packages/npm/
//gitlab.com/api/v4/packages/npm/:_authToken=${AUTH_TOKEN_GITLAB}
//gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/packages/npm/:_authToken=${AUTH_TOKEN_GITLAB}
```

## 5. Creating a GitLab Access Token

To authenticate with GitLab's Package Registry, you need to create an access token:

1. Go to your GitLab repository
2. Navigate to **Settings > Access Tokens**
3. Create a new token with these permissions:
   - _api_ (for API access)
   - _read_registry_ and _write_registry_ (for Package Registry access)
4. Give your token a descriptive name and set an expiration date
5. Copy the generated token - you'll only see it once!

## 6. Publishing Your Package

With everything set up, you can now publish your package to GitLab's Package Registry:

```bash
# Set your authentication token as an environment variable
export AUTH_TOKEN_GITLAB=<your_token_value>

# Build and publish
yarn build && lerna publish --yes
```

If successful, you'll see your package in the GitLab repository under the **Packages & Registries** tab.

## 7. Using Your Published Package

To use your published package in another project:

1. Create an _.npmrc_ file in the root of your consuming project:

```bash
@my-project:registry=https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/<project-id>/packages/npm/
//gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/<project-id>/packages/npm/:_authToken=${AUTH_TOKEN_GITLAB}
```

2. Install your package:

```bash
yarn add @my-project/my-lib
# or
npm install @my-project/my-lib
```

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit your _.npmrc_ file with the actual token value
- Use environment variables to inject your tokens
- Consider adding _.npmrc_ to your _.gitignore_ file
- Set appropriate token expiration dates
- Use the minimum required permissions for your tokens

## Troubleshooting Tips

- **Authentication failures**: Check that your token has the correct permissions
- **Package not found**: Verify project ID and package namespace match
- **Publishing errors**: Ensure package version is updated before republishing
